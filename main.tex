% \vspace{1mm}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The main goal of this research is to downturn the rate of pregnancy termination.
%     \item This research finds out the attributes that contribute to pregnancy termination and leads to propose a hybrid supervised machine learning approach.
%     \item This Hybrid approach generates 67.2\% accuracy considering the biasedness of the dataset which is relatively better than other classifiers in terms of performance metrics.
