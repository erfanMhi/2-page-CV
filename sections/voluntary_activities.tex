%         % 	\customcvproject{Dean at Rasht School of AI}{Oct 2018 -- present}{
%         %     I held five meetups in Rasht and lectured in four of them about topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Computational Neuroscience, Data Science, and Optimization algorithms. The materials of these meetups can be found \href{https://github.com/school-of-ai-rasht-chapter/Meetup-Materials}{here}. Furthermore, I designed a learning path for students who want to learn ML and Deep Learning. You can found it in \href{https://t.me/joinchat/GtdKmRJ2jXuzymyXm2RuQA}{this Telegram channel}. Moreover, I am currently mentoring several students who are motivated to pursue Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and Computational Neuroscience  (\href{https://www.credential.net/88276493-a749-4108-bdd2-6ea5a702be2c}{certification}).}
