% \section{RESEARCH EXPERIENCE}
% \textbf{"Feature Selection and Classification on BDHS(Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2014) data analysis:a hybrid approach for predicting pregnancy termination."}
% \vspace{1mm}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The main goal of this research is to downturn the rate of pregnancy termination.
%     \item This research finds out the attributes that contribute to pregnancy termination and leads to propose a hybrid supervised machine learning approach.
%     \item This Hybrid approach generates 67.2\% accuracy considering the biasedness of the dataset which is relatively better than other classifiers in terms of performance metrics.
% \end{itemize}
